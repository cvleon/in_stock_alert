# How to use 

1. Create a secrets.py file with all of these secrets:
- TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = SID from Twilio
- TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = Auth token from Twilio
- NUMBERS_TO_SEND_TO = List of phone numbers to send texts too
- TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER = Your twilio number that the text will come from.

2. Download some annoying sound from online and save it as alarm.mp3
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure the constants at the top of stock_checker.py - you'll need to download chrome driver and point to the path.
5. Run the script!
